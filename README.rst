Cumulus Driver for Autonet
-----------------------------
Autonet is a WSGI application that abstracts vendor specific network
device configuration into a standard set of vendor independent API calls.
The Autonet Cumulus driver allows Autonet to work with devices that use
Cumulus Linux.

See the full `documentation <https://connectria.github.io/autonet-cumulus>`_ for
